## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to build a [briefly describe what the project will achieve, e.g., secure and scalable system] to [describe the problem it solves]. The system will feature [highlight key features]. We aim to deliver high-quality software by following structured engineering practices, including requirements gathering, analysis, and design.

## Features
The system will provide the following functionalities:
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to securely log in and access their accounts.
- **Data Management**: Enables users to input, update, and delete records from a secure database.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically creates reports based on user activity or data inputs.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Sends alerts to users based on predefined events.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**
   - **Description**: The system must allow users to log in using a valid username and password.
   - **Scenario**:
     1. The user inputs a username and password.
     2. The system validates the credentials.
     3. The user is granted access upon successful validation.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: User should be logged in with valid credentials within 2 seconds.

2. **Data Input and Storage**
   - **Description**: Users can input and store data in the system.
   - **Scenario**:
     1. The user accesses the data entry form.
     2. The system saves the data securely in the database.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Data is stored without error, and validation ensures correctness.

3. **Report Generation**
   - **Description**: The system generates reports based on user inputs.
   - **Scenario**:
     1. The user selects the report generation option.
     2. The system retrieves relevant data and generates a report.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Reports are generated within 3 seconds.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The system must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with a maximum response time of 2 seconds.
2. **Security**: All user data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
3. **Scalability**: The system must be scalable to accommodate future growth without requiring significant redesign.
4. **Availability**: The system should be available 99.9% of the time.

## Use Case Diagram
![Use Case Diagram](path-to-image)

This diagram illustrates how users interact with the system to perform key functions such as logging in, inputting data, and generating reports.

## Context Diagram
![Context Diagram](path-to-image)

This diagram shows the overall system architecture and interactions between external actors and the system.

## Iteration 1 Deliverables
1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis**: Completed documentation of functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **Use Case and Context Diagrams**: Visual representation of system interactions.
3. **Project Repository**: The code and documentation are submitted through GitHub.
